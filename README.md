# AlphaAHB V5 Specification

## Overview

The AlphaAHB V5 Specification represents the fifth generation of the Alpha Advanced High-performance Bus (AHB) architecture, building upon the foundation established by the original Alpha Architecture Handbook (Version 4) from Compaq Computer Corporation.

This specification defines a modern, high-performance bus architecture designed for next-generation computing systems, with particular focus on integration with the Torus Kernel and OS/3 Astralis operating system.
